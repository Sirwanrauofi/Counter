# Counter
This JavaScript code is designed for a counter functionality. Upon the webpage fully loading, it initializes a variable count at 0, displayed in an element with the ID #counter-value. It adds click event listeners to buttons with the class .counter-btn. Clicking a button evaluates its class to determine the action (increase, decrease, or reset).
